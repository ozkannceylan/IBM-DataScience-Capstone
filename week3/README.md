**Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards**

In this section the interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards are created 

**First**,Launch Sites Locations are analyzed with Folium. This lab contains the following tasks:

TASK 1: Mark all launch sites on a map
TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

After completed the above tasks, some geographical patterns about launch sites were found

**Second,** A Interactive Dashboard was built with Plotly Dash

This dashboard application contains input components such as a dropdown list and a range slider to
interact with a pie chart and a scatter point chart. You will be guided to build this dashboard application via the following tasks:

TASK 1: Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component
TASK 2: Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown
TASK 3: Add a Range Slider to Select Payload
TASK 4: Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot
